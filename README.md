# PARAGON

An educational top-down story game. The player must complete quests to earn rewards and eventually beat the final boss, completing the game. Quests include battling monsters, exploring new areas, and helping NPCs.
Monsters are beaten by answering math questions of one of three difficulties chosen by the user, and drop items that can be exchanged for items in an item shop. As the player completes quests, more areas of the map become available.

# How it was made:
**Tech used:** Python, Pygame, Tiled level editor

This project was started as a grade 12 computer science summative, with minimal prior experience. Pygame was chosen to handle user input and graphics for the 2d game including many sprites. Because this project was a used as a means of 
creativity and exploration, all functionalities are coded from scratch, with research being limited to specific syntax and issues.
Some specific functionalities that were particularly pride-worthy:
- Grid-based player-centered (map scrolling) movement, including obstacles such as NPCs and trees
- A multi-layer 6400x6400 pixel map created using multiple free-use tile sets in Tiled level editor
- Data saving between instances utilizing .json file handling

# Skills Practiced:
 - Project progress tracking
 - Accountability in a project group
 - Self-directed exploration and research
   
 - File handling in Python
 - Object-oriented programming
